# Chemical and Products Database (CPDAT)
CPDat (Chemical and Products Database) is a database containing information mapping more than 49,000 chemicals to a set of terms categorizing their usage or function in 16,000 consumer products (e.g. shampoo, soap) types based on what chemicals they contain. The database is a part of EPA's Computational Toxicology (CompTox) Dashboard and contains data from other EPA databases including CPCat, CPCPdb and FUse. CPDat also contains data from non-targeted analysis of chemicals performed on different consumer products and from new product composition data that is publicly available.

For chemicals without a weight fraction in a given product, EPA scientists developed a model that generates a predicted weight based on its placement in the ingredients list. 

Users can search the CompTox Dashboard for chemicals by chemical name, Chemical Abstracts Registry Number (CASRN), or by a product type (e.g. "shampoo").
